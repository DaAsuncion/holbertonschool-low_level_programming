0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

General

 What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
 What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
 What are the differences between static and shared libraries
 Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

Requirements

 C
 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
 All your files should end with a new line
 A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 You are not allowed to use global variables
 No more than 5 functions per file
 You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
 You are allowed to use _putchar
 You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
 In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
 The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
 Don’t forget to push your header file
 Bash
 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
 All your files should end with a new line (why?)
 The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
 A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
 All your files must be executable


2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
 mandatory
 Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries. It should cover:

 Why using libraries in general
 How do they work
 How to create them (Linux only)
 How to use them (Linux only)
 What are the differences between static and dynamic libraries
 What are the advantages and drawbacks of each of them
 Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

 When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

 Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings
